International Women's Day (IWD) is a global area holiday celebrated annually on March 8 as a focal point in the women's rights movement. IWD gives focus to issues such as gender equality, reproductive rights, and violence and abuse against women.[3][4] Spurred by the universal female suffrage movement, IWD originated from labor movements in North America and Europe during the early 20th century.
